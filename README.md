# RunCheckHCDE310
Final project for HCDE310

Run Check is a program that grants the user information about the current state of the weather outdoors. Everything from the precipitation to the wind speeds, information that
would affect the user's outside experience is granted. Run Check is a program that was designed for out door atheletes but also out door commuters. I designed Run Check to grant
all the information that is needed by users going out doors that they should know before they go outside. The problem with current weather applications is that they bombard you with
too much information at once and finding what you want in a cluster of information is difficult. Run Check is a simple, straight to the point weather app for outdoor users.
Run Check is able to provide real time information from any city in the world.

  5. Open the Run Check folder and open a file titled API Key
  6. Copy and paste your API key into api_key = 'YOUR API KEY GOES HERE'
  7. Open app.py in the folder and run the program.
